# jekyll-post

A simple shell script that creates a .md file in the format that jekyll expects.

## Installation
Clone the repository to wherever you want it. You can now run `./jekyll-post FILENAME TITLE` from that directory.

Or if you would like to use the program often, you can copy it into your /usr/bin/ directory. Use `sudo cp jekyll-post /usr/bin/jekyll-post` to do this. After doing so, you should be able to access the program from any terminal using `jekyll-post FILENAME TITLE`

## Usage
